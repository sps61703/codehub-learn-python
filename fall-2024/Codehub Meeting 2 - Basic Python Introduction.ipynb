    "**Our goal is to get acclimated with the basic syntax of Python, the way I'm going to teach it is that we're picking up the \"grammar\" as we go along doing different things with the language. Today, we're starting super simple with storing primitive data into variables and printing messages to the console, and then if we have time getting more fun from there.**\n",

    "### Calculator on Steroids\n",

    "A pretty basic function of programming languages is to store data for you and do arithmetic calculations. Most languages get pretty hefty and make you define exactly what kind of variable you're storing, but Python's smarter and can pick up what you mean based on context clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's imagine a fairly basic scenario that we could otherwise use a pen, paper, and four-function calculator for, and then try to write the code for those tasks. **I want to write a sentence that describes my weekly budget for groceries.** Let's pretend for some reason I just want one, simple sentence describing what I want to do.\n",

    "First, I want to store the different things I have to buy. I really only have to run a small trip for Dr. Pepper, bread, and cheese. On a sheet of paper, I might write something like this:\n",

    "1. Dr. Pepper - \\$4\n",
    "2. Bread - \\$7 (i like croissant bread from Kroger and trust me it's worth it)\n",
    "3. Mozzarella Pearls - \\$3\n",
    "\n",
    "The same way we translate between languages like English and Spanish, you can translate this information to Python! The typical syntax is `[variable name] = [some value]`. In Python, watch what happens when you try to write spaced out words:"
