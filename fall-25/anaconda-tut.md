# how to download anaconda

1. go to [the anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and create an account. keep an eye for which version it recommends for your system; nine times out of ten, it'll detect the system for you and find the appropriate version to download.
2. once you get to [the success page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success), download the appropriate version for your chip + system. for ex., I own a 2024 MacBook Air with an Apple M3 (silicon) chip, so I'll download the apple silicon MacOS version.
3. open the Anaconda navigator, and find the Jupyter Notebook launcher.
4. launch and go crazy
