    "## The Python Interpreter\n",
    "<a id='interpreter'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Excecution of Python programs is often performed by an **interpreter**, meaning that program statements are converted into machine executable code at **runtime** (i.e., when the program is actually run) as opposed to **compiled** into executable code before it is run by the end user. This is one of the primary ways we'll interact with Python, especially at first. We'll type some Python code and then hit the `Enter` key. This causes the code to be translated and executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation allows great flexibility (interpreted programs can modify their source code at run time), but it's often the case that interpreted programs run much more slowly than their compiled counterparts. It's also often more difficult to find errors in interpreted programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can interact with the Python interpreter via a prompt, which looks something like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (base) C:\\Users\\user1>python\n",
    "    Python 3.12.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Apr 15 2024, 18:20:11) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n",
    "    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "    >>> print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "    Hello World\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, the `print` function prints out a string representation of the argument. The `#` denotes a comment, and the interpreter skips anything on the line after it (that is, it won't try to interpret anything after the `#`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can save Python code into a program file and execute it later, too. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also interact with Python using Jupyter Notebooks (like this one). When we hit `Run` in the menu bar, we are performing an action analogous to hitting enter from a command prompt. The code in the active cell will be executed. Users should be aware that though we are intereacting with a Web page, there is a Web server and Python enviroment running behind the scenes. This adds a later of complexity, but the ability to mix well-formatted documentation and code makes using Jupyter Notebook worthwhile.\n",

    "## Python Identifiers and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "An **identifier** in Python is a string used to identify a variable, function, class, etc. in a Python program. It can be thought of as a proper name. Identifiers start with a letter (a-Z) or an underscore `_`; this first character is followed by a sequence of letters numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain identifiers, such as `class` or `if` are builtin **keywords** and cannot be redefined by users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As in most programming languages, **variables** play a central role in Python. We need a way to store and refer to data in our programs, and variables are the primary way to do this.  Specifically, we assign data values to variables using the `=`. After the assignment has been made, we may use the variable to access the data as many times as we like. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the righthand side of an assignment statement is evaluated first (e.g., 1+1 is evaluated to 2), and afterwards the result is stored in the variable specified on the lefthandside. That explains why the last line below results in a value of 6 being printed. Regarding the second assignment to `blue_fish`, when evaluating the righthand side, the current value of `blue_fish` (3) is added to itself, and the resulting value is assigned to `blue_fish`, overwriting the 3."
